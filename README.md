This program can be used to analyse truss structure(like 'link180 in Ansys').<br>
A truss structure consist of nodes and struts.the "InputData" show the format of<br>
this structure.<br>
Before analysing,external forces and node constraints must be set.<br><br>

And the results of this program are almost same as Ansys.<br>
There are two pictures show results of this program(running in a GUI environment)<br>
and results of Ansys.<br>

Use Finite Element Method to analyse Truss structure.<br>
Use Eigen to Solve the Sparse Matrix.<br>
